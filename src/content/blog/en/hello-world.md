# Tech Selection

## Why I choose Astro

I have had the idea of building a personal website for a long time, but I have not made any substantive progress. Until recently, I saw an article on Zhihu introducing [Astro](https://astro.build/), a new static site generator. The point that directly attracted me was that it was relatively easy to mix React, Vue, Svelte and other front-end technologies in a project. Previously, I have basically only learned React, and I have tried Vue 3, but I have not decided which technology to use to build this website. And Astro's feature makes me feel that this is a good opportunity to try various front-end technologies.

> Although at present, this website does not use any front-end framework except Astro. (ｰｰ;)
>
> But I am still very looking forward to using more front-end technologies in the future.

In addition, Astro also has many design features that are suitable for building static websites for blogs. However, many features have not been deeply used on this website, and I will explore them slowly in the future.
